# PHPortal
PHRP provides hospital infection control staff with the ability to electronically exchange information about reportable disease conditions with the local Public Health Department.
PHRP saves time by using data from other systems and automatically completing sections of the reportable disease form that must be submitted to the Health Department.

This software is freely distributable under the Apache 2.0 license.

Written in Java with Perl scripting for some automation utilities.  Uses other open source platforms such as Apache Tomcat, Derby and ActiveMQ.
